Building a successful football roster takes more than four years of planning and decision-making. This project aims to develop both a data pipeline and an interactive, user-friendly visualization tool that leverages off-field performance data to generate comprehensive athlete profiles. These profiles support comparison, benchmarking, and progress tracking across multiple seasons. Using R for data preparation, Firebase for data storage and retrieval, and JavaScript for front-end development, the project processes over four years of performance data and presents each athleteâ€™s relative strengths and weaknesses within their position group. The tool also enables coaches to easily enter and update athlete data, as well as select athletes for side-by-side comparison, making it a practical resource for informed decision-making from recruitment to game day. Many thanks to Professors Xiaojiang Li and Mjumbe Poe for their insightful guidance and technical mentorship throughout the project, and to Coach Miguel Rivera for the data and many hours of thoughtful, iterative feedback.
