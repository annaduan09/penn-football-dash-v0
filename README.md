This tool is designed to build, visualize, and save reports on athletes' physical attributes and off-field performance metrics. Athletes are benchmarked against five years of data from their position group, and the charts provide a visual diagnostic of their overall performance.

This project was completed as part of MUSA6110 (Java Script Programming for Planning Applications) and MUSA0802 (MUSA Capstone) with the support of Professors Mjumbe Poe and Xiaojiang Li. Many thanks also to Coach Miguel Rivera for providing the data and providing much-needed context for the stats collected.
